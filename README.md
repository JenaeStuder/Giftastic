## Giftastic is an HTML, CSS and JavaScript application that utilizes Ajax calls as it queries the giphy API. It also uses logic that allows the user to start the gif when they want to instead of it starting on loading to the screen. It also pulls the gifs ratings and posts them to the top of the gif.


### Click on the tags already provided to have gifs show up.
### Double click on gifs to make them animate.
### Type in a key word for gifs you would like to see and hit find more.
### Laugh hysterically at what you find.


### Loading the app will show you this page

### Once you choose a tab it pulls random Gifs from the Giphy API and posts them to the HTML.

### If you click on another tab it appends the new gifs to the top of the previously selected ones

### You can add as many categories as you choose and it will always pull random gifs matching the category from the Giphy API
